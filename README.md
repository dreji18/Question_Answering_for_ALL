# question_answering_for_all
This tool tries answering data related to any query if the information is available in Wikipedia, Twitter and Youtube. The data is dynamically created once the query is passed and the QnA module answers from it. The data is ranked and prioritized based on the query. Images and Youtube videos are fetched with the help of a couple of packages. Finally, a summary will be created and auto-downloaded for the reference.
